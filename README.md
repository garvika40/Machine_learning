Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my daily challenge of implementing different machine learning algorithms. Each day, I will choose an algorithm, study it, and create a Python implementation from scratch. This challenge aims to deepen my understanding of various machine learning models and techniques.
Algorithms

Below is a list of the algorithms I have implemented so far. Each algorithm has its own directory containing the implementation, a README file explaining the theory behind the algorithm, and a Jupyter Notebook with example usage.

    Linear Regression
    Logistic Regression
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Decision Tree
    Random Forest
    K-Means Clustering
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    Neural Networks
    Gradient Boosting

Note: This list will be updated daily as new algorithms are added.
